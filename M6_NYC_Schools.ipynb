    "# Introduction\n",
    "For this Milestone, you’re joining the New York City Department of Education as a data analyst intern. Your first assignment is to explore a dataset containing recent information on NYC public high schools, including enrollment numbers, demographics, and socioeconomic indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to better understand the landscape of public high school education in NYC by analyzing key metrics such as total enrollment, percentage of students with disabilities, English learners, and students living in poverty. By visualizing these variables and investigating potential relationships between them, you’ll help uncover patterns and raise important questions that could inform future policy decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work here lays the foundation for data-driven improvements in educational equity, resource allocation, and student support across the city’s schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, import both the pandas library and the plotly.express library."

    "The median being higher than the mean indicates a left-skewed distribution, meaning that while most schools have very high poverty levels, a smaller number of schools with lower poverty rates are pulling the mean downward. This skewness suggests that high poverty is the norm in NYC public high schools, but a few relatively affluent schools exist within the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference of 5 percentage points between the mean and median is noticeable, but not extreme—especially considering the standard deviation is relatively large (19%). A high standard deviation means there's a wide range of poverty levels across schools, so variation of this size between the mean and median is within an expected range. It reflects real disparities across schools and neighborhoods, rather than statistical noise.\n",

    "In summary, while the difference between the mean and median is meaningful, it is not unusually large given the high variability in the data. It signals that most schools serve predominantly low-income populations, but there is enough variation in the dataset to reflect a small number of outlier schools with significantly lower poverty levels"
